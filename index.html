            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            It&apos;s easy to throw money at a problem, but where should you invest it to maximize 
            the likelihood of winning a national championship? To answer this question, we analyzed 
            two large datasets to discover correlation(s) between NCAA Men&apos;s Basketball game performance 
            and the amount each university allocates into specific athletic expenditures. A prior study examined 
            the &quot;impact of athletic expenditure on athletic performance&quot; among NCAA Division I Institutions 
            (Beaudin, 2017). With expenses increasing annually, it&apos;s more important now, than ever, 
            for universities to best distribute athletic funding to best improve performance. 
            Essentially, there exists a positive feedback loop of &quot;spending leads to athletic success 
            which in turn leads to institutional benefits&quot; (Suggs, 2003).
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Problem
        </h2>
        <p>
            Division I universities invest millions each year into their men&apos;s basketball 
            teams, with spending ranging from updating facilities to bidding for athletes 
            with scholarships. Annual athletic expenditures are created to maximize the 
            likelihood of winning a national championship, but there&apos;s no definite answer 
            as to where investments will make the largest impact. Through understanding 
            the relationship between expenditure categories and team performance, we can
             better inform teams on where to best invest their money to have the greatest
              return on investment.
        </p>

       <h2>
           Data Collection
       </h2>
       <p>
        Our dataset was created from datasets sourced from Kaggle and Sportico. 
        The dataset sourced from Kaggle consists of 9 tables tracking team statistics such as games won, 
        adjusted offensive efficiency, effective field goal percentage shot, etc. The dataset sourced from 
        Sportico tracks team expenses in various categories such as total expenses, support / administrative staff compensation, 
        athletic student aid, game expense, direct overhead, etc., across 4 years. Combining the team performance statistics 
        from the Kaggle dataset and the athletic expenditure categories from the Sportico dataset allowed us to have a
        holistic dataset to examine the relationship between overall team performance based on athletic expenditure categories.
       </p>

       <h2>
           Data Cleaning
       </h2>
       <p>
        To match the financial and team statistics, we had to clean our dataset to better fit our data. 
        Our tables were trimmed of non-numeric data, such as team names, which conference a team competed
        in, etc. We also had to homogenize data for years where we did not have a complete set of financial 
        data for all the teams for which we had stats for, as well as expenses that were not reported. 
        In addition, the team performance statistics did not track the same set of features across the 2018 to 
        2021 season. To combat this, features that were not shared between all of our tables, for each season between 2018 to 
        2021, were trimmed out. In one notable case, we removed the data regarding placement in the national championship tournament 
        since the championship tournament (March Madness) did not happen in the year 2020. We discarded the prospect of estimating tournament 
        placement for that year as it seems to be a formidable research problem in its own right. Our goal remains to examine the impact of financial 
        investment across various athletic expenditure categories to effective team performance.
       </p>

       <h2>
           Data Preprocessing
       </h2>
       <p>
        Having collected and cleaned our data, we continued to preprocess our data so that we could find the best correlation between 
        measures of athletic expenditures and measures of team performance. We created a feature, Win Percentage, that was calculated 
        for each team and year by dividing the number of wins by the number of games that particular team played. This is relevant as 
        teams that ranked higher had opportunities to play more games than a lower ranked team. The nature of how NCAA D1 works could 
        skew our data in the sense that playing more games gave room for more wins; however, playing more games would equate to playing 
        against more difficult opponents. We sought to avoid reliance on this unsteady wins value with the addition of Win Percentage (wins/games). 
        We anticipate this factor to be an important element in demonstrating the effectiveness of financial investment in a basketball team. 
        We then went on to pair athletic performance data with the corresponding financial data for each team and year. Finally, 
        before moving on to learning methods, we normalized the data to aid processing. Lastly, we implemented backwards feature selection 
        to help us discover which features (athletic expenditure categories) would help us best predict effective team performance (see more under Methods).

        The primary approach taken to find was to directly compare financial investment in each category to each game stat. However, due to 
        the incompleteness of the dataset from sportico, there were many underreported values.

       <h2>
           Methods
       </h2>
       <p>
        Our group focused on the supervised learning method of linear regression. Our research goal involves identifying specific financial 
        features that had the greatest effect on measures of athletic performance, so we determined that feature reduction was an essential part of our model. 

        Two procedures of feature reduction and linear regression were considered. The first was backward elimination of features followed by a 
        cross-validated ridge regression model trained on the resulting reduced group of features. The second was a direct application of cross-validated 
        lasso-reduction in order for the reduced and relevant features to be selected automatically.
       </p>

       <h4>
           Backward Elimination
       </h4>
       <p>
        To best use the data, backward elimination was used to choose the financial features that were most impactful. 
        This also helped in getting rid of factors that were too skewed due to the excessive underreporting as mentioned previously.
        Using a significance level of 0.05 (95% confidence), we first fit a full model including all the features, and then 
        iteratively remove the feature with the highest p-value that is greater than the significance level, fitting a new model without the removed feature each time.
        Running backward elimination with the financial features as X against each athletic statistic one by one, we get that for each of the 
        team statistics, we keep the following features:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Expenses
            </li>
            <li>
                Support/Administrative Staff Compensation
            </li>
            <li>
                Athletic Student Aid
            </li>
            <li>
                Game Expenses
            </li>
            <li>
                Direct Overhead Expenses
            </li>
        </ul>

        The financial features that were removed through backward elimination were:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Athletic Facilities
            </li>
            <li>
                Coaching Salaries
            </li>
            <li>
                Equipment and Supplies
            </li>
            <li>
                Athlete Meals
            </li>
            <li>
                Recruiting
            </li>
            <li>
                Sports Camp
            </li>
        </ul>
       </p>

       <h4>
           Ridge Regression
       </h4>
       <p>
            Although using pure Linear Regression would have almost certainly produced a model which 
            more closely matches our data more precisely, we decided to utilize a cost function, such as the 
            L²-norm penalty in Ridge Regression, in order to avoid overfitting. Again, we used the reduced set of financial 
            features used above in order to more easily observe the effect of what we identified as the most influential variables. 
            Finally, the scikit method we used, RidgeCV, includes cross-validation. This allowed us to identify an alpha coefficient which 
            more closely maximizes the accuracy of our Ridge Regression model.
       </p>

       <h4>
           Lasso Regression
       </h4>
       <p>
            As an alternative to the two methods utilized above, we used Lasso Regression to perform both tasks, feature reduction and linear regression. 
            The L¹-norm penalty tends to produce a model with many coefficients of value 0. This operates similarly to the backwards feature selection 
            performed above, resulting in a selection of a subset of features with nonzero coefficients used in the model. Again, with the scikit built-in 
            cross-validation of LassoCV we were able to select a value of the alpha coefficient that helped maximize the accuracy of our model. 

            Running Lasso regression resulted in the following relevant features (those with nonzero coefficients):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Expenses
                </li>
                <li>
                    Coaching Salaries
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support/Adminstrative Staff Compensation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Athletic Student Aid
                </li>
            </ul>

            The following financial features that were ignored:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Athletic Facilities
                </li>
                <li>
                    Equipment and Supplies
                </li>
                <li>
                    Athlete Meals
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recruiting
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sports Camp
                </li>
                <li>
                    Game Expenses
                </li>
                <li>
                    Direct Overhead Expenses
                </li>
            </ul>
       </p>

       <h4> 
           Support Vector Regression
       </h4>
       <p>
        The last method we utilized is Support Vector Regression, a model that applies the techniques of Support Vector Machines to a regression 
        task. This was chosen because, with the proper kernel, the model can capture nonlinear relationships between the financial data and the 
        athletic performance data. The possibility of nonlinearity was a feature ignored by our previous models, both of which were purely linear 
        regression models. Unlike our other regression models that try to minimize the mean squared error for all data points, the SVR uses support 
        vectors, which means utilizing a subset of the training data; this can help the model generalize. In our implementation of the model we used 
        the radial basis function kernel because it is a non-linear kernel that works well with our data. On an important note, this choice of kernel 
        eliminates the possibility of an easily interpretable model. If this model shows startling improvement, we will have to question the effectiveness 
        of an understandable model.

       <h4>
           Effectiveness of the Regression Models
       </h4>
       <p>
            The two approaches to creating a linear regression model were effective to a 
            high degree of similarity. Even though our models weren&apos;t effective at 
            predicting win percentage, as it turns out, each was effective at predicting other measures, 
            including Barthag, ADJOE, ADJDE and WAB. These were predicted by our models with the average R-squared values 
            of 0.46, 0.32, 0.37, and 0.41, respectively. Upon considering the implications, it makes a bit more sense as to why 
            these statistics were more strongly correlated. The Barthag is a team&apos;s power rating as an estimate of that particular 
            team&apos;s likelihood of winning against the average DI team. It&apos;s a value between 0 and 1, and the higher the better. 
            Adjusted offensive efficiency (ADJOE) and adjusted defensive efficiency (ADJDE) are estimates of the corresponding 
            offensive or defensive effectiveness, where the ADJOE is the points scored per 100 possessions against the average DI 
            defense and the ADJDE is the points allowed per 100 possessions against the average DI offense. WAB is a unique statistic 
            in that it measures a particular team directly against what a bubble team would be expected to perform. A &quot;bubble team&quot; 
            is a term describing a team that qualifies for the NCAA March Madness Tournament, the national championship. This value is 
            derived from examining how many more wins does a particular team have compared to the amount of wins that a bubble team 
            would be expected to have if they faced up against the same schedule. Each of these measures is highly regarded as an 
            effective predictor for success in NCAA basketball. Although we initially hypothesized that win percentage would be well 
            predicted and be a useful measure of the positive effect of funding, these other two measures of athletic performance are 
            similarly, if not more, useful when analyzing a team&apos;s effectiveness.

       <h4>
            Similarities and Differences Between the Regression Models 
       </h4>
       <p>
            The backwards selection/ridge regression model selected five features and the lasso regression model selected four. 
            Surprisingly, they only held three in common: Expenses, Support/Administrative Staff Compensation, and 
            Athletic Student Aid. Their commonality suggests that they are the most useful predictors. Each is intuitively important 
            for a basketball program, most obviously Expenses, but their unique significance asks for closer inspection. On the other 
            hand, lasso regression alone considered Coaching Salaries, while the backwards feature selection process uniquely claimed 
            the features Game Expenses and Direct Overhead Expenses. The fact that these models consider these different features yet 
            perform exceedingly similarly seems to imply that these measures are either highly correlated or they add relatively little 
            to the accuracy of the model. As the two models show wildly different predictions for less accurate categories (ORB and 3P_D, 
            to name two), we hypothesize that they are in fact simply weaker indicators of athletic performance than the shared three 
            features.

        (Fig. 3 - Predictability of athletic performance model comparing Ridge Regression model against SVR model)
       </center>

       <p>
        The SVR model indicates similar results in comparison with the Ridge Regression. 
        We can see a similar trend in the high accuracy for features like ADJOE, ADJDE, and BARTHAG. 
        If we direct our attention to the BARTHAG feature, we can see a significant improvement in accuracy. 
        By utilizing the SVR model, we were able to improve the R-squared value by about 10 percent, which is very significant. 
        For certain features, using the scikit package, we encountered negative r-squared values due to the poor performance of the model, 
        however, these categories were also poorly predicted by our other models. Overall, this is important in showing that our more basic, 
        interpretable linear models are similarly effective to a black-box model like SVR with a radial basis function kernel. The overall performance 
        of the model demonstrated desirable results by showing consistency R-squared accuracy for each feature.

       <h2>
           Conclusion
       </h2>
       <p>
        Athletic statistics exist to highlight a team&apos;s performance in comparison to the rest of the teams that competed that season. 
        It would make sense from this perspective that any given team&apos;s overall effective performance can be measured from how well they 
        stack up against their average opponent for that competitive season. Viewing this information through our research, it becomes more 
        visible that athletic expenditures (specifically expenses, coaching salaries,  support / administrative staff compensation, athletic student aid) 
        are not simply numbers to be tallied off, in fact, many have a measurable impact on specific measures of performance. With the implementation of 
        our models, we have illuminated important relationships between the distribution of funding and the effectiveness of an athletic program.
